= Flash Gallery Extension

An extension that works with Todd Dominey's excellent SlideShowPro (SSP)
Flash component to easily create Flash-based media galleries for your
Radiant site.

**********
THIS EXTENSION IS CURRENTLY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
**********

NOTE THAT SSP IS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT -- SEE PURCHASE INFORMATION BELOW

After installation be sure to update Radiant!

  rake radiant:extensions:flash_gallery:update
  rake radiant:extensions:flash_gallery:migrate

You'll also need to purchase a copy of SSP from http://slideshowpro.net
Unfortunately it's not OSS. However, there is a free trial version
available that includes a standalone version suitable for testing this
extension (it limits you to displaying only 3 images/videos).

To use it, copy slideshowpro.swf or your customized version of the SWF
to the public/galleries directory. You can then add new galleries and
media items using the administrative interface in Radiant. To display
them in SSP, just use the supplied Radius tag:

<r:gallery name="gallery_name" />

This extension contains the Paperclip Rails plugin v2.1.5 (c) 2008 Thoughtbot. 
All other code (c) 2008 Nick Plante.
